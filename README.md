# Welcome to justInvest

## File structure note:
To have better naming and readability of the code, rather than naming each file after the problem it was made for, the 
files for each problem are grouped together in a package labelled problem1, problem2, problem3, and problem4.

## Running the application
To run the application follow these steps:

(This assumes that the .zip archive has been downloaded and extracted)
1. In the terminal, navigate to the main directory `cd JustInvest`
2. Run the following command to build the jar file `./build.sh`
   - If this does not work run the command `chmod +x build.sh`
3. Run this command to start the application `java -jar build/justInvest.jar`
